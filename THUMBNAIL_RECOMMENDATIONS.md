# Thumbnail Recommendations for Low-Level Projects

I've set up your low-level projects with placeholder thumbnails. Here are the best sources and recommendations for finding or creating proper thumbnails:

## Recommended Image Sources (Free & Commercial Use)

### 1. **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com)
- High-quality, free photos
- Commercial use allowed
- Search terms: "network", "circuit board", "server", "code", "technology"

### 2. **Pexels** (https://pexels.com)
- Free stock photos and videos
- No attribution required
- Good for tech-themed backgrounds

### 3. **Freepik** (https://freepik.com)
- Free vectors and illustrations (with attribution)
- Premium option for no attribution
- Great for tech illustrations

### 4. **IconScout** (https://iconscout.com)
- Tech illustrations and animations
- Some free, some premium

## Specific Recommendations for Each Project

### 1. **Custom VPN Implementation**
- **Search terms**: "VPN network", "secure tunnel", "encryption", "cybersecurity"
- **Style**: Dark background with glowing network nodes, blue/purple colors
- **Alternative**: Use a circuit board with network pathways

### 2. **Mini Kernel**
- **Search terms**: "CPU architecture", "processor", "circuit board", "microchip"
- **Style**: Close-up of a processor/chip, orange/blue color scheme
- **Alternative**: Abstract architecture diagram

### 3. **Git Clone - Version Control**
- **Search terms**: "git branches", "tree structure", "version control", "code collaboration"
- **Style**: Branch visualization, green/cyan colors (like git's branding)
- **Alternative**: Abstract tree/network diagram

### 4. **Redis Clone - In-Memory DB**
- **Search terms**: "database", "data storage", "memory", "cache"
- **Style**: Red/orange theme (Redis brand colors), fast data visualization
- **Alternative**: Abstract data flow illustration

### 5. **Snap Package Manager**
- **Search terms**: "package", "container", "software distribution", "modules"
- **Style**: Purple theme (Snap branding), boxes/containers
- **Alternative**: Abstract package dependency diagram

### 6. **Custom Programming Language**
- **Search terms**: "compiler", "code syntax", "programming", "abstract syntax tree"
- **Style**: Colorful syntax highlighting, cyan/yellow colors
- **Alternative**: Code transformation visualization

### 7. **Multi-threaded HTTP Server**
- **Search terms**: "server", "network", "parallel processing", "HTTP"
- **Style**: Green/blue colors, parallel lines showing threads
- **Alternative**: Server rack or network visualization

## Quick Solution: Generate with AI Tools

If you want to quickly generate thumbnails, you can use:

1. **DALL-E** (https://labs.openai.com)
2. **Midjourney** (https://midjourney.com)
3. **Leonardo.ai** (https://leonardo.ai) - Free tier available
4. **Ideogram** (https://ideogram.ai) - Free option

### Sample prompts for each project:

```
1. VPN: "A sleek tech illustration of VPN network with glowing blue encryption tunnels, dark background, cybersecurity theme, 16:10 aspect ratio, modern minimal style"

2. Kernel: "Operating system kernel architecture visualization, glowing circuit patterns in blue and orange, CPU core, dark background, technical diagram, 16:10 aspect ratio"

3. Git Clone: "Version control branch tree structure, glowing green nodes connected by lines, code commits, dark background, developer tools aesthetic, 16:10 aspect ratio"

4. Redis: "In-memory database visualization, fast data streams in red and orange, key-value storage, dark background, high-performance theme, 16:10 aspect ratio"

5. Package Manager: "Software package manager with purple connected boxes, dependency graph, installation flow, dark background, modern UI, 16:10 aspect ratio"

6. Programming Language: "Compiler pipeline from code to bytecode, colorful syntax transformation, lexer parser AST, cyan and yellow gradient, 16:10 aspect ratio"

7. HTTP Server: "Multi-threaded server with parallel green threads handling requests, network data flow, dark background, high-performance, 16:10 aspect ratio"
```

## Current Setup

Currently, all low-level projects are using the Venom VCS thumbnail as a placeholder. Once you have proper images:

1. Save them to: `/src/assets/images/projects/`
2. Name them appropriately (e.g., `vpn.png`, `kernel.png`, etc.)
3. Update `/src/data/projects.jsx` to import and reference them

Would you like me to help you set up the imports once you have the images?
